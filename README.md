# Flipper Zero Bad USB feats Lazagne

Currently only for windows 10 and 11

I came with the idea after trying and testing some paylodas from https://github.com/I-Am-Jakoby/ <a href="https://github.com/I-Am-Jakoby/">

Still a repo under testing but there are 2 options:

One is slower because is all in ducky script and you have to wait until your script is done to disconnected. The fast one does it in one second.

- 1 slow one: is all done in ducky script, sends you the resaults via email you have to change your smtp credentials. 
- 2 Fast one: A simple ducky script request a link were the payload is  alocated

### Instructions

At the moment only avaiable for discord webhook

### Fast Option
- Fork and clone the repository
- Search por dc in the code and change it with your discord webhook link. Right now do it in both .txt and .ps1. (In the next days i will change it to just do it on the .txt)
- Upload your changes
- Get raw view from the payload and copy the link. 
- Make it shorter with https://link.iamjakoby.com/ and option 307
- Copy that link and put it in the .txt file. 
- Copy to your flipper zero and execute!

### Slow option

- Change your email and smtp options where is indicated
- Copy to your flipper zero and execute!

Have fun!!

Any error or problem please open a issue, is my first payload and probably doesn't work as expected in all computers.

### ToDo

[] Make it a BushBunny payload
